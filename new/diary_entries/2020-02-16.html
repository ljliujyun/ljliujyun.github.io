Hi. It's me again. It's you again. Writing is tiring. Picking the right words is tiring. So I am just going to write down whatever that comes to my mind, although my mind in in a mess, and my logic is in a mess.
Still, it is important to write down whatever it is that I am thinking. Maybe someone will read this, maybe no one will read this. Does it matter? Probably yes, but whatever. It matters the most that I write things down now.
I am scared. I am not scared now. I am just feeling scared in general. I am scared of people in genral. To be precise, I am scared of you this one particular human being now, although other human beings are sometimes still quite scary. What am I scared of? I am scared of the malice hidden in you that I see. I might be seeing things wrongly. It's not the first time, and it's not uncommon. But this is what I see. I see the malice, and I am scared.
You see. .. Probably I shouldn't address you as a you. Even the imagination of talking to you makes my palm sweats and my heart speeds. This is how frightened I can be when I think of someone.
Okay. Let's start again. Calm myself down and start from somewhere else. Maybe I can start from the very beginning. My childhood.
You, another you now, you had always hit me. That's the first thing that comes to my mind whenever I think of you, everytime I think of you. You didn't really harm me seriously physically. Yes. I can still remember the heat burning on my chin, the world spinning from your slap right on my head, the ear tissues cracking like my ear was coming off, but no, you didn't break my bones, didn't stab my eyes, didn't put me in any life threatenning situation. Physically there was no damage done that managed to stick with me till now. Oh but mentally? I think there is. Your eyes when you where about to slap me in my face, sometimes your hand stopped in mid air and my body was already all tense and curlled up. Can you remember? I can. A few years ago I told you I could remember. I told you how hurt I was, because I wanted to stop you from making another mistake, abusing my brother. You said one thing. 點解你咁記仇. I hoped for an apology, and all I got was another hurtful response. Well, I was naive. Why did I expect an apology from someone who cannot even face oneself, who has commit so many ugly ugly undeniable crimes.
Once, you smashed my violin to pieces, and I cried so much and I didn't stop, and you didn't stop hurting me either, no matter how hard I cried. Then I pulled out all the coins that I had saved in my hidden box, all the coins from different countries. I begged you for something with the money. I forgot. But I knew at the time, right? All you value is just money. Maybe this is a wrong statement. You don't just value money. But you do trust money with all the faith that you have got.
You are my mother afterall, and you were hardwired to love me. Yes, you have shown love. You try to fulfill me materialistically as best as you can. That is the only thing you know. Is that love? Maybe. But that is not the main point here. The main point was you once hurt me, and the malice in you is like an enormous cold blooded hand in the dark gripping the tiny me and squeezing me to death. The fact that you were supposed to love me only made it worse.
I am not scared of you anymore. I have no longer been scared of you since the day I shoved past you, yanked my room door open, stormed out home and banged the door behind me shut, while all you could do was to ask me to get back, at the same time realising you could longer physically overpower me, and you had already lost me. Now, I just despise you. Sometimes I pity you though, but that feeling always vanish when I actually see you. I once thought of mending the relationship, but no, it's not the relationship that had gone wrong, it was you, and it is not up to me to fix. I don't really hate you, but I just despise every single bit of you with great hate.
Vulnerable things are interesting, because a lot can be learnt by seeing how people treat them. You give someone absolute power and see what they can do. How can that not be interesting? I was a child. I loved you. That was one of the most vulnerable thing on earth. Yet you showed me the worst of humanity.
