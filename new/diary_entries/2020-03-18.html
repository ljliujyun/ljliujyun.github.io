I have been trying to avoid thinking. I have been trying to avoid feeling. I think I am trying to block off everything. I just want to sleep forever. At the moment I don't really mind getting the virus. Might be a good way to die, so people around me won't need to feel guilty for my death. I don't really understand why some of you are now worrying about me. What do you want from me? Is there the chance that you just want to be nice to me without wanting anything back? If I can disconnect from everyone I know and start a new life somewhere else, that will be good. I will then be no one, be someone unimportant. Speak less. Show less. Be nothing. Be worthless. Maybe then I can see people for who they are a bit easier. Unlike now I am so confused.
I kinda want to get away from this state, but I don't think there is place worth going, other than a place where no one knows me.
I don't want to work towards a meaningless goal. I don't want to give myself a lie and live in a dream. Not anymore.
