What have I done?
● Video editting whole day - spent a lot of time searching for images
What have I learnt?
● When working on something that I don't have much experience. It is better to learn the basics -> dive in and have a feel -> Learn some more basics -> Dive in again to explore more -> AND then really follow some tutorial because there might be more efficient ways to do things which I didn't know.
● Save you work!!!! 30 mins of work gone...
