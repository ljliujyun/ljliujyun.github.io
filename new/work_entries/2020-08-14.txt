What have I done?
● Finished off the robotics lesson plan and catalogue
● Editted the first 30 seconds of the video
What have I learnt?
● I was kinda upset. The pressure from 4th year project was quite immense. I was not in a good condidtion. Therfore, I <b>felt</b> like I couldn't help with Lantau project, and my input was not valued. Looking back, there was nothing to feel upset about. 寵辱若驚，貴大患若身。
● I was able to be super productive because I worked on my own.
● When editting videos, a possible flow is script -> footage preparation -> footage sequencing -> footage trim -> footage effect -> footage transtion
