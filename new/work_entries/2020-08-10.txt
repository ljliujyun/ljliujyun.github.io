What have I done?
●Spent the morning making the robotics curriculum with Maria.
●Afternoon - carried on with the curriculum, filling in the details

What have I learnt?
●It is important to do things in the right order with the right people. Maria and I finished the curriculum in such a short time because she has the knowledge what the curriculum should look like and I have the knowledge in robotics.
●The process of learning - knowing, understanding, recombining. When reading a book, first skim through, then read in detail while writing point form notes; Draw local mindmaps, then global mindmaps. Lastly, apply the knowledge.
