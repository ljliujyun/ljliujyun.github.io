What have I done?
● Today was the big day! Workshops in the morning and in the afternoon. Met so many experts from different fields. Have never done something like this before.

What have I learnt?
● Miro is really a useful tool for drawing mindmaps - it is also very good for holding online Workshops
● Ceas has so much confidence when talking in front of so many people. I think I need more experience in taling to different people.
● When I was wrapping thought the breakout session, I made the mistake again. I was speaking so fast, didn't stress main points, spitted out all my thoughts and didn't really deliver them.
● As a timekeeper, what is my role actually? I think I should ask Maria...
● This week has been tough, but the fact that I was working with such nice people make the work enjoyable. I thin the most important thing when choosing work is not the type of work itself, it is the people around. To be honest, the people can shape work into the way they want.
● I think one of my strength really is drawing mindmaps - finding the relationship between different ideas and linking them.
● The main point of the workshop is to identify the values behind the expert's decision. I think there are three main design principles - to link, to understand, to repect, and to build identity.
First, to link. When working on a design project, it is super important for all stakeholders (everyone affected and designers, etc) to come together. Without linkage, nothing is possible. 先有人與人之間的連繫，才有理解，才有尊重，才可以合作(連繫青年、連繫鄉村的不同派別、連繫政府和鄉村). To link people, it is important to have a platform - 人與人要有互相見面、相處的空間、平台和時間，才可以促進到溝通。 Second, to understand - to understand is to link people at a deeper level, and without understanding it is difficult to have respect (鄉村傳統文化). Third, to respect - to respect is to let each other be their comfortable self. Lastly, it is important for each individuals to maintain their unique indentities.
