Afternoon:
⚫subtitle work...
⚫Had a chat with Maria about learning to reject
Evening:
⚫On the way home, had a chat with sabrina about the name of the trees and protecting yourself

what have I learnt?
⚫when presenting, give breaks to listeners...
⚫Wow! I now know how to add subtitle to videos efficiently!!! What a new skill to unlock XD
⚫Wow! Sabrina can actually name most of the trees as we walked. This is so amazing. I now know a few names and now I feel like I they are my new friends.
⚫Learning to reject is difficult as we have the tendency to satisfy others... but it is necessary.
⚫I should really leave at the right time to avoid waiting for minibuses.
