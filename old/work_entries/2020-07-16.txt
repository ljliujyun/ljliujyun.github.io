what have I learnt?
⚫in a meeting, or working with people, it is really important to let everyone know about the goals. So we have the vision aligned. Start with WHY.
⚫Braille is more complicated than I thought. Rmb what you design has to be meaningful.
⚫when designing, really need to have a focus on user experience - this is what maria is really strong at
⚫learnt a lot about arduino - it is not as complicated as I thought. A lot is already done in libraries
⚫from etextile - when working on projects, the best result can only be achieved if u actually know the details. Dont just follow steps blindly and hope to arrive the result by chance.
⚫People from different areas gather tgt and work on something. This is really an amazing experience. I didnt know something like meetUp existed.
⚫dont work when sleeping, its really unproductive
⚫have rests when working. It's part of working, just smarter.
⚫dont bring your laptop and arduino back home. its heavy. you have better work to do at home. read and rest.
