What have I done?
●Lantau project - meeting with Ceas, Maria and Emma. Came up with a plan for co-design 2.
●Learned how to use adobe premiere.
●In the end I made a video that doesn't fit the style they want... too funny lmao

What have I learnt?
● When doing group work, it is important to step in early before everything picks up momentum (in the wrong direction). When discussing about co-deisgn 2, I started making the mindmap when they were talking. In this way, I managed to point the discussion in the right direction - making sure they know the goals!!
● I learnt about miro!!! a fantastic mindmaping tool.
● I also know the basics of adobe premiere now!!! Actually so much better than imovie and shotcut. 
● When working, make sure you are working in the right direction. I made the video according to what I wanted, not what Maria wanted - I should have asked Maria what she wanted first. However, there wasn't really a time to ask her because she was just so busy. I shouldn't have started making the video then...
