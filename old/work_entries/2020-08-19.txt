What have I done?
● Typhoon day - work from home. Trial co-design 1 workshop in the morning. Then, meetings and meetings... to improve the workshop. My role was facilitator and time keeper.
What have I learnt?
● Time keeping is actually more difficult than I thought. I don't really have an accurate feel of 'time'. What can be achieved in 3 minutes? I think this really just comes from experience.
