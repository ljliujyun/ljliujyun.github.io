●In the afternoon, learnt how to use a sewing machine. Then starting making the intruder alarm project demo.

What have I learnt?
●SEWING MACHINE!!!
●ESP8266 is difficult to work if.
●If something doesn't work, just stop and take a rest. I didn't really stop in time, and I carried on working hoping that it will work out in the end. However, I was so tired already and it didn't really make sense to do any work. I did manage to make myself stop though, just a bit late.
