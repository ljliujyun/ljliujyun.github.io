Sunday

What have I done?
Morning:
●Woodwork induction with mmt,hok and hok'sis
Afternoon:
●Meeting with Maria about lantau project
●Helped out with woodworking - hok made a box!
Evening:
●Meeting with Maria again!
●Got back home really late...

What have I learnt?
●I helped them with woodworking... I am really glad that they had the chance to craft something for themselves. Crafting really is something so natural that to us. Hum... this week has been super busy and I am reaching my limit - the stronger I am, the more I can offer.
●Lantau project required us (me and maria) to come up with so much in such a short time, and it turned out that the work isn't so necessary. It's like rushing back to office finding out that I could have been a bit late... This is a bad habit that I have. Sometimes I can be more chill for the chill work.
