<b>Benefits of being a vegan</b>
Health - I am fairly sure it is much more healthier to have a plant-based diet.
Lives of animals - I think as human beings it is in our genes not wanting to hurt most species of animals. If we all actually need to perform the killing part of consuming meat, I think most of us will turn vegetarian at once. I gave up dairy products not long ago too. Simply can't imagine myself sucking milk from a cow's breast - I mean, cow milk is 'designed' for calves and we are not calves. I think eggs are less cruel in a way, at least I don't really feel guilt eating them - the egg does not feel pain. However, factory farming of eggs is just inhumane. 
Protecting the enviornment - The modern meat-eating culture, in which we consume an extremely large quantity of unnecessary meat, is severely damaging the enviroment. I only knew this after watching Cowspiracy. We chop down the forest for land to grow crops that feed the cattle. We feed the cattle with such a large quantity of water. Methane is produced by cows and it is so much more harmful than CO2 considering greenhouse effect. There can't be a real enviromentalist that knows all these and continue to consume unnecessary meat without looking for a change....

<b>Vitamin B12</b>
There is a debate whether vitamin B12 is accessible to a vegan without supplement. Bascially vitamin B12 comes from the soil. Animals eat quite a bit of soil that's why vitamin B12 is in animal products. We wash the soil away when eating vegs so we don't get the vitamin. Some say it exists seaweed but some say it's not.
