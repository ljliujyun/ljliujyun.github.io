    <p><i>// "Out of so many manufacturing techniques, I only know laser cutting,” the visitor said.</i></p>
    <p><i>“I tend to come up with design ideas that can be laser cut. This really has limited my imagination...” //</i></p>

    <p>The other day I overheard a conversation between a visitor and my mentor, Maria. What he said stayed on my mind, because I could feel him. One thing that I have experienced over the last 13 days - <b>new knowledge opens new possibilities of imagination.</b> </p>
    <p> ⚫One of my tasks is to make a laser cutting curriculum. I did research and looked at others’ work at MakerBay, then I realised - a laser cutter can actually do so much more than I thought. So right now I am making the prototype of a foldable chess board that has a living hinge in the middle with two rotatable panels… Oh, maybe I could DIY a laser cutter and start a laser cutting business...</p>
<p> ⚫To make the curriculum, I have also learnt the basics of Inkscape. It is a software similar to Adobe Illustrator, but it is free and open source. Now I can add some fancy 2D graphics on my designs. Maybe I can also try designing some logos…</p>
    <p>⚫Another task that I have is to make an ‘electronics and robotics library’. I need to organise a huge cupboard of electronic components and buy some mechanicals parts. Right now I am learning about the basics of Arduino, and there are already so many ideas floating in my imagination. Could I make a semi-automatic farm? Could I make a 3G-controlled car?</p>
    
    <p>    There are so many things I want to make, and the flood of new knowledge has opened up new pathways to achieve what I want. Thinking of this gives me a thrill of excitement. However, I should keep in mind that a mindless mix of different technologies does not give a good design. Having new pathways should not mean more detours, it means the possibility of a shorter, better route.</p>
    <P>(There are many other experiences at MakerBay. I helped with a 5-day workshop about microplastics, went for a social design trip at Sha Lo Wan, talked to someone who was making a soft robotic gripper, had a chat with someone designing a solar-powered fridge… Oh, I also replaced a broken toilet seat cover today, and Thomas said I can add ‘Professional Plumber’ to my CV, but that is for another blog post.)</P>
