What have I done?
LANTAU PROJECT TILL 1115pm

What have I learnt?
●When doing a project, it is super important to indentify and illustrate the project logic. It is difficult and time consuming, but it is necessary to point everyone to the right direction. Think of the cost of producing something that's not useful at all.
●To identify the project logic, a flow chart is useful.
●However, details are often needed to identify the project logic. That's why it is an iterative process, filling in details can help identifying the logic - identify logic, fill details, correct logic, fill details, then once the logic is more or less firm, it will be very efficient to complete the remaining details. 其實說到底，就是順應自然。先找到自然的規律，再順著規律而行。此為唯一方法。若然把先後次序調轉，或者跳過一些必然經過的階段，願景只會難以實現。某程度上，LCC和MKB去做這個project，也是順應自然的重要一環，起碼這一群人努力堅持初心，不是為交貨而做，要有這份心意，願景才有可能實現。
●I really want to help them with the project. However, I should admit the fact there are parts that I can't really help much. I can provide extra brain power to put things in logic, but I can't really work on the actual content as I missed the expeditions and co-designs.
●This team works because there is a good synergy between people. We have a similar 'aura' I guess.
