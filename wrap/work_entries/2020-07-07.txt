<b>What have I done?</b>
Morning:
⚫Learned a bit about Motors on https://www.instructables.com/class/Large-Motors-Class/
⚫Openned the Makeblock Makerspace kit
Afternoon:
⚫Put together a part list for major mechanical parts in the Makeblock kit
⚫Had a talk from Paul who is doing some testings on a fridge
⚫Helped with laser cutting for the Lantau project

<b>What have I learnt?</b>
⚫Learnt about motors - solenoid valves, stepper motor, encoder motor, etc.
⚫Learnt about different actuators - linear drive, timing belt + timing pulley, chain + sprocket, track + timing pulley, shaft + pulley + collar + connector
⚫Practice with laser cutter - engraving and cutting on corrugated cardboard
⚫Had a chat with Maria:
⚪Inkscape is a good software to do 2D design for complicated shapes to be laser cut
⚪Arduino boards can be wifi connected so an LED can be controlled from distance. Maybe a automatic farm? Or a (super) remote control car/ drone?
⚪A database is required to do IOT. Maybe I can learn more about php/ python back-end.
⚫The design of a fridge powered with solar pannel - relys on water as a thermal mass since water has the property that it is densest at 4 degree C, so a convection is possible, kinda similar to how lakes never freezes? I suggested instead of one giant door, make seperate small doors, which seems sensible to me.

<b>Others</b>
⚫Met new people and had fun with people from LCC - Sabrina, Klaus, Ceas
⚫Ceas made noodles for us
⚫Spoke a few words with Yuri
⚫Thomas seems nice
