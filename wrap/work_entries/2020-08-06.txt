Thursday

What have I done?
●LSK ppt and present
●Worked on wood science
●Did a presentation for the lesson ppt that I made

What have I learnt?
●When presenting, look at audience, and speak slowly. The purpose of a presentation is not to speak about what you know. It is about delivering what you know. It is even better to speak less and deliver less as oppose to speak more and deliver nothing.
●You have tried working on your own things in MKB. It hasn't been productive. There are people who talk to you, breaking the chains of thoughts. There are trivial work that you might need to do. Therefore, you should really schedule a particular time slot that you can stay away from people, and work on your own things.
