Wednesday

What have I done?
●Hackthon till 5pm.
●LSK ppt afterwards.

What have I learnt?
●How to run a hackathon. First identify problems using sticky notes, then rank the problems according to importance and feasiblity, selecting the highest ranked few. Next, carry out a dicussion about the problems with possible solution. Have a vote in the end.
●After the ideation part, the hackathon got disorganised. We discussed about how to make the idea work, but it was not efficient at all. Partly due to language, partly due to personality, and partly due to group size. It might have been better if people work in a group of 2 or 3. Also, we should have started prototyping earlier, instead of thinking of the final version.
●Stand up and stretch when u are tired!
